## Versions:

### Implemented:

- v1 = Play music stream by hard coded file_path, simple UI and keybinds to restart, pause, resume, volume_up, volume_down and quit.
- v2 = Attach audio_processor to capture stream frames and draw rectangles on screen based on the frames.
- v2.1 = The animation is too fast. Made a ring buffer to slow it down.
- v3 = Implemented FFT and used it on the left channel samples to draw animation.
- v4 = Added support to hot reloading. Can make sepated functionalities at the file libplug.so and then with pressing r in the app, and rebuilding libplug.so, you can reload the version of libplug.so without having to restart the app.
- v4.1 = File_path not hard coded can be provided as argument
- extra: Made macros to auto generate code for hot reloading functions. (* extra branch not merged in main)
- v5 = Drag and Drop: using raylib to load files dropped.
- v5.1 = file_path argument is now optional
- v5.2 = Deals with files dropped that are not music

### TODOS:

- [ ] Remove hot reloading to reduce unecessary complexity
- [ ] Remove callback support for mono files (Raylib make everything 2 channels)
